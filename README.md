# Apportionment-Problem
## Aim
The aim of the project is to create a visualization of the seat distribution among various states in India over the years (see [this](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/historical-apportionment-data-map.html) for a US-related example). The hope is that doing so will give us a better understanding of:

>how the seat distribution is affected by changes in population,

>which population subgroups (based on gender, religion, or any other relevant classification) are benefited/harmed by specific apportionment procedures,

>which apportionment procedure is the most "reasonable" in the Indian setting, etc.
